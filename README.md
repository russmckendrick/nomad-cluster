Nomad Cluster
====================

This Ansible playbook will launch a Nomad cluster in DigitalOcean, it is based on the getting started which can be found [here](https://www.nomadproject.io/intro/getting-started/install.html).

## Setup

Create a file called `do.yml` in the `group_vars` folder, this file should contain your DigitalOcean API token and also the name of the ssh key you want to use.

```
echo 'do_api_token: "sdnjkjdfgkjb345kjdgljknqwetkjwhgoih314rjkwergoiyu34rjkherglkhrg0"' >> group_vars/do.yml
echo 'ssh_key_name: "Your Key Name"' >> group_vars/do.yml
```

### Notes on SSH keys

If the key matches one that you already have present in DigitalOcean then you must use the exact name associated with the key, if you don't you will receive an error stating that the key already exists. If you don't have a key on the machine you are running Ansible on then one will be created and uploaded.

## Running Ansible

To run Ansible run;

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml
```
